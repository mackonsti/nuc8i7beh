# Intel NUC Model NUC8i7BEH

This repository contains personal work and files, developed and maintained for a successful use with [OpenCore EFI bootloader](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) on this specific Intel NUC model. There are **no** ready, pre-packaged EFI solutions provided; instead, the needed configuration and ACPI files are published for those interested in studying the code, while creating their own bootloader configurations.

${\textsf{\color{red}The project resumes after repairing a hardware fault affecting all USB ports of the NUC motherboard.}}$

## Required BIOS Settings

For the essential but _required_ BIOS settings, as well as previous firmware releases, see [BIOS](BIOS/) folder.

## OpenCore Picker Keyboard Shortcuts

When the `Timeout` key is set and OpenCore Picker displays the available boot drives:

* Press **Space Bar** to access the hidden _Auxiliary_ tools e.g. UEFI Shell, NVRAM Cleanup, Verify MSR Lock.
* Press **Tab** to move selection to the newly available Reboot and Shutdown icons (since OpenCore 0.6.8).

Alternatively, if `ShowPicker` is disabled or `Timeout` set to 0, keep pressing **Escape** or **Zero** or **Option** keys to access Picker just before OpenCore kicks-in and starts booting.

## Active Configuration

* No CPU ID faking required, power management is native; MSR `0xE2` remains locked; :warning:
* External USB 3.0 ports work as expected; using generated `USBPorts.kext`;
* Internal USB 2.0 headers not used; they are disabled in BIOS;
* External USB-C port works for display purposes; special USB-C to miniDP cable used;
* Intel graphics acceleration works as `0x3EA50004` with [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/whatevergreen/releases);
* Analogue audio output works as layout ID `0x03` with [AppleALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/releases/);
* Digital audio output works with `FakePCIID.kext` and the HDMI Audio extension;
* Embedded Intel LAN interface works with [IntelMausi](https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi/releases);
* Embedded Intel WLAN module works with [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases);
* Embedded Intel BTLE module detected with [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases);
* CPU fan readings work with `ec-device` as `Intel_EC_V8` with [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases);
* Integrated Realtek SD card reader now gets support with [RealtekCardReader](https://github.com/0xFireWolf/RealtekCardReader/releases);
* Power Management is present and active as `X86PlatformPlugin` is attached to `PR00` in IORegistry;
* Sleep/Wake both work without issues; see "Power" section in [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool/releases);
* Both NVMe and SSD SATA interfaces work with no effort nor kext needed.

For the complete list of all detected PCI hardware components and their respective addresses via `lspci -nn` command (in Ubuntu, loaded via USB) see [here](Various/lspci-nn.txt). This list was created with all devices enabled in BIOS and is used as a device "map" so that PCI IDs can be detected before tweaking the hardware (and BIOS) to run macOS.

## Intel Iris Plus Graphics 655 Properties

The `AAPL,ig-platform-id` property set to `0x3EA50004` is used for **WhateverGreen** to successfully enable acceleration on this graphics device [[8086:3ea5]](http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/8086/3ea5). This ID represents the following properties and connectors:

| Properties             | Value(s)                               |

## USB Port Mapping on NUC Chassis

| USB 2.0 Port Name | USB 3.0 Port Name | Hardware Location  | Controller     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| HS01              | SS01              | Front RIGHT socket | Primary XHCI   |
| HS02              | SS02              | Front LEFT socket  | Primary XHCI   |
| HS03              | SS03              | Rear BOTTOM socket | Primary XHCI   |
| HS04              | SS04              | Rear TOP socket    | Primary XHCI   |
| HS10              | N/A               | Internal BTLE port | Primary XHCI   |
| HS01              | SS01              | Rear USB-C socket  | Secondary XHCI |

The above active and working USB ports are listed in Hackintool while the two *internal* (USB 2.0) headers and **Consumer IR** are all _disabled_ in [BIOS](BIOS/) and **all unused or non-referenced USB ports** are removed. In any other situation, ports such as HS05, HS06, HS07, HS08, HS09, USR1, USR2, SS05 and SS06 may be listed. All ports above are defined in `USBPorts.kext` according to their _electrical_ connector.

## CPU Fan Reading Support

Support for the NUC's embedded chipset **ITE IT8987E-VG** has been added in [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases) (and more specifically `SMCSuperIO.kext`) since version 1.2.2 thanks to its developers. This is achieved by injecting the needed property `<key>ec-device</key>` and the correct identifier that corresponds to the NUC's model/generation own **LPC Controller** device (see [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/blob/master/Docs/EmbeddedControllers.md)). For this NUC, the value is `<string>Intel_EC_V8</string>` thus enabling CPU fan readings in any monitoring tool.

![SMCSuperIO](Various/SMCSuperIO.png)

## Wireless Connectivity

The embedded 802.11ac wireless 9560 chipset [[8086:9df0]](http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/8086/9df0) has been working without issues with [itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) since Mojave. The controller can be enabled in BIOS, and for aesthetic reasons, can be renamed from `Device (CNVW)` to `(WLAN)` via OpenCore patching. As for the embedded BTLE module, Intel reports it being a Bluetooth 5.1 device, which works in _most_ cases with [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware) since Mojave, too. Both drivers can be loaded through OpenCore.

## CPU Power Management

With the injection of `SSDT-PLUG.aml` via OpenCore, we can verify that Power Management is present and active as `X86PlatformPlugin` is attached to the first CPU core `PR00` per the [Dortania Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/pm.html).

## Changes Brought About by macOS 12 and later

MacOS 12.x _Monterey_ has brought an important change in OpenCore configuration for BTLE, namely the required removal of **IntelBluetoothInjector.kext** and its replacement by **BlueToolFixup.kext** found inside [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) package. The main **IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext** remains active and must still be loaded, as done previously.

:warning: From version 2.2.0 of [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases) onwards, there is a new kext **IntelBTPatcher.kext** included that the developers recommend loading as it fixes a bug in Apple's _Monterey_ re-written Bluetooth stack. For more details read [here](https://openintelwireless.github.io/IntelBluetoothFirmware/FAQ.html#what-is-intelbtpatcher-trying-to-fix).

There is also a distinct version of [AirportItlwm.kext](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases) compiled for _Monterey_ only that has to be installed, replacing the Big Sur version of the kext _without_ any OpenCore configuration changes, however.
